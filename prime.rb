#You'll be defining a method, prime?(), that takes in an integer argument and returns a boolean of whether or not that integer is a prime number.

#A few things to think about:

#What defines an integer as a prime number? Research algorithms for how to determine if a number is prime.
#How do you create a range of numbers? How do you turn a range into an array so that it can be iterated over?
